# Analysis and Visualization Data Scientist Jobs

## Introduction
<p align = "justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, I will share my analysis and visualization what I did on Data Scientist Jobs Dataset. The dataset I got from Kaggle (Source : https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-scientist-jobs ). The dataset scraped from glassdoor, and it contains 3909 rows data and 17 columns(that is ‘Job Title’, ‘Salary Estimate’, ‘Job Description‘, etc). From that dataset, I have analyzed and visualized it to gain informations from that data and also make the data can be easily understood.

## Data
<p align = "justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the pandemic many people lost their jobs, with this dataset it is possible to hone the job search so that more people in need can find employment. This dataset was created by picklesueat and contains more than 3900 job listing for data scientist positions, with features such as:
- Salary Estimate
  
- Location

- Company Rating

- Job Description

- and more.

## Summary (Analysis and Visualization)

### Word cloud of job lists

<p align = "justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the figure above, we know open recruitments its not only for data scientist job. So, we drop data which doesn’t contain data scientist or data science in Job title columns, because we want to explore only data scientist jobs.
